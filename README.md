# DRAGONfly
This repository contains all control algorithm for the Purdue team's autonomous glider "DRAGONfly" for competing in the NASA FLOATing DRAGON Ballon Challenge.

## About the competition.
[NASA FLOATing DRAGON Ballon Challenge](https://floatingdragon.nianet.org/)
>> Through the FLOATing DRAGON Challenge, NASA seeks innovative ideas and prototypes for a guided data vault recovery system consisting of: 1) a deployer that can be mounted to a HASP-type balloon gondola; and 2) a node that can be dropped and fall gracefully to a pre-determined, safe waypoint for recovery.
