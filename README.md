# DRAGONfly
This repository contains all control algorithm for the Purdue team's autonomous glider "DRAGONfly" for competing in the NASA FLOATing DRAGON Ballon Challenge.

## About the competition.
[NASA FLOATing DRAGON Ballon Challenge](https://floatingdragon.nianet.org/)
>> Through the FLOATing DRAGON Challenge, NASA seeks innovative ideas and prototypes for a guided data vault recovery system consisting of: 1) a deployer that can be mounted to a HASP-type balloon gondola; and 2) a node that can be dropped and fall gracefully to a pre-determined, safe waypoint for recovery.

## Purdue University team's proposed design: "DRAGONfly"
### Overall Summary
Purdue DRAGONfly is an autonomous, deployable, folding-wing, high altitude recovery vehicle. Our design will dive through the upper atmosphere at near-transonic speeds, from deployment altitude to  approximately 30,000 ft. As the air in the upper atmosphere is extremely thin, traditional methods of controlled  descent are impractical due to the low-density atmosphere which significantly reduces the effectiveness of control  surfaces. In addition, high wind speeds, especially when passing through altitudes of 30,000 to 50,000 ft, have the  potential to drift our node large distances away from the target. These two factors drove our team to design a  flight system that will fall through the upper atmosphere quickly, transitioning to conventional flight at lower  altitudes.
