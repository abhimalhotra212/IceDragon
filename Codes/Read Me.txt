Purdue Ice Dragon Spring 2024
Jump Start Codes

There are two different jump start codes. 
For both codes, the arduino that is FURTHER from the Purdue logo gets programed with these jump start codes.

The purpose of the jump start code is to detect if the voltage on a part of the power distribution board is too low, and 
it then "jumps" the voltage, bringing it up to what is it supposed to be.

"JumpStart1" is the code that programs the arduino that is on-board the AIRCRAFT. This actually does the needed jump starting.
"JumpStartGondola" programs the arduino on the gondola. This code does NOT do any jumping, and constantly has the jumpers off.
Jump starting isn't needed on the gondola, since the power distribution board is only on the aircraft.

IMPORTANT NOTE if changing the codes:
Outputting the pins for the jumpstart as a 
"1" means there is NO jumping. 
"0" means there IS jumpstarting.
Take note how it is flipped from what would be expected (this is due to the circuit design itself).
